# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, we are tasked with using Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24hr and 7day price changes.

The mains steps of this challenge are preparing data, finding the best value for k using scaled dataframe, cluster cryptocurrences with K-means using the scaled dataframe, optimizing clustesr with Principal Component Analysis, find best value for K using the PCA Dataframe, and then cluster cryptocurrencies with K-mean using the PCA dataframe.

The code in this challenge is based off past activities. Xpert Learning assistant was used to help refined the code and gave pointers are parts of the code where I had trouble getting it to work.
